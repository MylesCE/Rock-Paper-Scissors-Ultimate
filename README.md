This is a simple game of Rock Paper Scissors. It is my first project i've coded in C#, But I am veRy proud of it. I love pushing myself to leArn new thIngs and seeing what I can do. I hope you eNjoy this little application!

In its v1.2 state, the game is now a lot more staBle with many mOre features, and with manY more gambling mechanics. Please enjoy everything the game has to offer to your hearts content

I plan to eventually make another, more complex game soon, so be on the lookout!
